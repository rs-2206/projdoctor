          <p class="text-muted">The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the livelihood and psychological stress of low-income persons in suburban Bangladesh.
               The vast majority of respondents claimed that it was difficult to obtain work owing to COVID-19's lockout in order to meet their daily household costs. The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are not just health-related,
                but also have a significant influence on social and economic factors. According to reports, the COVID-19 would have a negative impact on the livelihoods of about half of the worldwide workforce, both in cities and in rural regions.
               According to reports, more than 10 million people in Bangladesh would be increasingly disadvantaged as a result of pay and employment losses.
               According to Bodrud-Doza et al., many low- and middle-income individuals in Bangladesh would lose their occupations and income sources as a result of COVID-19 outbreaks. 16 In previous outbreaks,
                it was seen that the poor and impoverished individuals suffered the most from the presence of any infectious disease.</p>
          <p class="text-muted">The government proclaimed stimulus packages and social safety net measures to help the country's socioeconomic position amid the COVID-19 epidemic. The economic stimulus measures, on the other hand,
               were geared for major industries and service sectors. Nonetheless, financial incentives should be offered to the poorest and most disadvantaged populations first. According to our findings, 
              just a tiny percentage of respondents got government assistance on a regular basis. Shammi et al. observed that after catastrophes, the ultra-poor are frequently left out of relief efforts.
              A sense of governance from public service providers is required to guarantee that benefits from the government's social safety net programmes reach the most vulnerable citizens.
              During this rare moment, it is also critical to consider alternative small-scale companies in which individuals may participate from home and earn a subsistence income. Relevant authorities, both public and private,
               might step forward to launch or support such initiatives. If this occurs, public movement will be curtailed, and COVID-19 transmission throughout the community will be regulated. Positive cases of COVID-19 in Bangladesh have remained more than a thousand per day (1320 confirmed cases on November 2, 2020), 
              despite the fact that daily reported cases were more than 3000 during June-July of the same year due to the opening of economic activities and uncontrolled movement of people.</p>
          <p class="text-muted">Limited economic opportunities, restricted movement, fewer opportunities to meet relatives, friends, and neighbours from whom they used to seek assistance in emergencies,
               fear of being infected with COVID-19, and a lack of confirmed government supportâ€”all of these factors had made lower-income people's lives vulnerable and stressful. Because of the lack of consistent income, 
               a high proportion of the respondents in this survey were concerned about their survival. Because they were trying to maintain their personal hygiene due to budgetary restrictions, they grew concerned about becoming infected with COVID-19.
               Individuals are often worried, panicked, and have diminished social networks during epidemics and catastrophes. Rajkumar emphasised the need of mental health services, particularly for disadvantaged communities, 
               as well as the establishment of social networks in order to mitigate the negative psychological impact of any outbreak. The COVID-19 dilemma has had a significant impact on the mental health and well-being of whole societies, and this is an important concern that must be addressed.
                Adopting a "Whole-of-Society" approach in the COVID-19 national response to promote, protect, and care for mental well-being is critical because it improves programming quality, 
               improves public coping skills during the crisis, reduces suffering, and is likely to speed up community recovery and rebuilding.</p>
          <li><h5 class="text-muted">Conclusion</h5></li>
          <p class="text-muted">The COVID-19 epidemic has caused significant economical and psychological distress in people all across the world. Despite the fact that all segments of society have been affected,
               lower-income individuals have grown more susceptible. The COVID-19 epidemic has affected the livelihood of individuals in poor nations, where the bulk of people rely on their daily income. The lack of a source of income, the worry of becoming infected with the coronavirus, 
               and limited government aid have made their livelihood precarious and stressful. To stop the spread of the coronavirus,
               public mobility must be restricted, which necessitates measures such as lockdown, isolation, and social distance.
               In order for these measures to be effective in a densely populated nation like Bangladesh, impoverished people need be supplied with vital government support throughout a certain time period. Otherwise,
                disease transmission would continue, perhaps having a long-term impact on the country. The purpose of this study was to swiftly determine the influence of COVID-19 on the psychological state and livelihood of low-income persons in Bangladesh. There were several limitations to this study. For starters, 
                it only questioned 576 people across numerous areas in Bangladesh. As a result, generalising the results to the entire country may not be appropriate. Additional research with more individuals spread around the country can be undertaken. 
               Second, in order to comprehend the influence, we only looked at a small number of factors.
               However, future studies can accommodate more variables of psychological and livelihood impact so that a general scenario of the impact can be produced extensively.</p>
