           <p class="text-muted">Nowadays,many people are addicted to fast food since it is convenient and tasty, but 
           none of them consider the negative consequences, so let us look into it.</p>
        <h4 class="text-muted">Effects of Fast-Food on body</h4>
          <h5 class="text-muted">Headache</h5>
          <p class="text-muted">Eating meals high in salt, such as many fast foods, might raise your chances of getting a headache.</p>
          <h5 class="text-muted">Depression</h5>
          <p class="text-muted">Eating fast food or processed foods may raise your chances of developing depression.</p>
          <h5 class="text-muted">Acne</h5>
          <p class="text-muted">Carbohydrates, not grease, can cause acne. Carbohydrate-rich fast food, such as French fries, hamburger buns, and potato chips, may cause acne outbreaks.</p>
           <h5 class="text-muted">Dental Distress</h5>
           <p class="text-muted">Carbohydrates and sugar in fast food release acids that can erode tooth enamel. Cavities in the teeth might result from this.</p>
           <h5 class="text-muted">Heart disease or stroke</h5>
           <p class="text-muted">High cholesterol and high blood pressure are two of the leading risk factors for heart disease and stroke.</p>
           <h5 class="text-muted">Shortness of breath</h5>
           <p class="text-muted">Extra calories might add up to extra pounds. Obesity may become a reality if there is no activity to counterbalance the increase in calories. Even if you undertake very little physical exercise, obesity can induce shortness of breath and wheezing.</p>
            <h5 class="text-muted">High Cholesterol</h5>
            <p class="text-muted">Fried meals are high in trans fats. These lipids have been linked to an increase in LDL (bad) cholesterol levels.</p>
            <h5 class="text-muted">Weight Gain</h5>
            <p class="text-muted">Even if you believe you are eating "healthily," you may be underestimating the quantity of calories you consume. This can result in unintended weight gain.</p>
            <h5 class="text-muted">High Blood Pressure</h5>
            <p class="text-muted">Fast food is often high in salt, which can raise blood pressure or worsen pre-existing cardiac conditions such as congestive heart failure.</p>
            <h5 class="text-muted">Extra Calories</h5>
            <p class="text-muted">People who eat at fast food restaurants consume an additional 187 to 190 calories each day.</p>
             <h5 class="text-muted">Blood Sugar Spike</h5>
             <p class="text-muted">Fast food is high in empty carbs, which can induce insulin spikes on a regular basis. This might happen as a result of your body's normal insulin reaction.</p>
             <h5 class="text-muted">Insulin Resistance</h5>
             <p class="text-muted">Fast eating can cause insulin rises on a regular basis. Insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes can result from this.</p>
             <h5 class="text-muted">Bloating and Puffiness</h5>
             <p class="text-muted">If you consume too much salt, your body may retain water, making you puffy, bloated, and swollen.<br>
             As we've seen from the list of fast-food side effects, it's past time to shift our eating patterns from bad to healthy.<br>
             Let's look at the advantages of eating well.</p>
             <br> 
             <hr>
             <br>
             <h4 class="text-muted">Effects of Healthy Eating</h4>
             <p class="text-muted">What you eat has a significant influence on how your body operates. Eating properly or poorly may have a significant impact on both the physical and emotional components of your body. Eating a nutritious diet has a great effect on your body. You'll find that you're feeling better and functioning better. A balanced diet may help to balance your body and allow it to perform at its best.</p>
             <h5 class="text-muted">Physical Benefits</h5>
             <p class="text-muted">Eating healthily enables your body to work more efficiently. When you eat well, you feel more alert. Because your body isn't attempting to run on sugar and fat, you have more energy to spare. Eating a well-balanced diet of grains, fruits, vegetables, dairy, and protein provides your body with all of the nutrients it requires. Consuming fruits and vegetables is also thought to lower your chance of developing certain cardiovascular illnesses, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and cancer. Your body performs better physically when you eat a nutritious diet.</p>
               <h5 class="text-muted">Mental Benefits</h5>
               <p class="text-muted">The physical benefits of good eating aren't the only ones; there are also mental advantages. When your body is performing optimally, you not only feel more alert, but also more focused. Your concentration might then lead you to engage in a variety of activities. The more concentrated you are, the more you can do. Eating healthily may also improve your mood and reduce your stress. When your body is satisfied and working well, your mental health is much more stimulated.</p>
            <h5 class="text-muted">Adult's Benefits</h5>
            <p class="text-muted">Eating healthily and eating your veggies isn't simply something a mother teaches her children; it's a lesson that everyone can learn. Even if you're no longer developing, it's critical to receive all of the vitamins and nutrients your body need as an adult. Adults should consume two to three servings of fruits and vegetables each day, according to the USDA. Eating healthily as an adult becomes increasingly vital as your body ages. Your body requires good nourishment in order to perform correctly and remain youthful.</p>
            <h5 class="text-muted">Children's Benefits</h5>
            <p class="text-muted">The dietary habits that youngsters establish as children generally follow them into adulthood. It is critical to teach youngsters about healthy eating so that they can grow up to be healthy adults. A healthy-eating youngster is more awake and aware, helping him to excel in school as well. Children who eat poorly are also more prone to gain weight. Children who eat healthily can prevent these weight issues and have more opportunities to be active. When it comes to good nutrition, both children and adults reap the same physical and emotional advantages.</p>
            <br> 
             <hr>
             <br>
             <h4 class="text-muted">Quick recommendations for a nutritious diet</h4>
             <p class="text-muted"> There are several simple, helpful strategies to enhance diet, such as:
                <ul>
             <li> water and herbal tea for soft beverages</li>
            <li>Avoiding meat for at least one day each week and ensuring that each meal contains at least 50% fresh food</li>
             <li>Consuming whole fruits instead of liquids, which have less fibre and frequently include added sugar avoiding processed meats, which are rich in salt and may raise the risk of colon cancer eating more lean protein, which can be found in eggs, tofu, fish, and nuts</li>
             <li>Taking a cooking lesson and learning how to include more veggies into meals may also be beneficial.</li></ul>
            In summary, healthy eating provides various health benefits, such as lowering the risk of heart disease.</br>
            Healthy eating provides several health benefits, including a lower risk of heart disease, stroke, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. It can also improve a person's mood and give them more energy.</br>
            A doctor or a dietician can advise you on how to eat a healthier diet.<br>
            So it's high time to make a promise to shun fast food.</p>
